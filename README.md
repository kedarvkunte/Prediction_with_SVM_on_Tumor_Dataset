# Prediction_with_SVM_on_Tumor_Dataset
Here classification on the tumor dataset is performed using Support Vector Machine. Tumor dataset has nine features and a binary output.  Nine features correspond to measurements obtained from medical imaging data. The output labels are logic 1 or 0 and corresponds to the presence or absence of tumor.

## Dataset
Dataset consists of training dataset, labels for training dataset and test dataset as the text documents.

## Requirements
* Python 3.5 or higher
* Numpy
* Sklearn

## Results

* Extracted tumor dataset with input having nine distinct features, binary labeled output and applied SVM classifier.
* Used Linear, Polynomial & RBF Kernels to improve accuracy and chose the best model by tuning Hyperparameters.
* Successfully ranked in top 28% in Kaggle competition (out of 170 participants) to predict presence of tumor.
